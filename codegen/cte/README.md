CTE Grammar for ANTLR 4
=======================

This Antlr4 grammar is used to generate the CTE parser for this library.

See [Parser.go](../../cte/parser.go) for how this grammar has been integrated.

### TODO

- Define the proper character ranges for stringlike (see the bottom of [CTELexer.g4](CTELexer.g4)).
